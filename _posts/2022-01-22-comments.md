Now you can leave comments on this blig. 

The comments feature is implemented by [disqus](https://disqus.com/). It has good documentation, so you can easily follow the process. In brief, (1) you need to make an account in disqus.com and do some configuration and (2) edit `_config.yml` file, `_includes/disqus_comments.html` file. (If there is no such file in `_includes` directory, check the `_layouts/post.html` file; there would be `{% raw %}{%- include disqus_comments.html -%}{% endraw %}`-like code in it, and this line tells you what file you have to edit.

### Why do we need another flatform like disqus?
Github page is a *static* website hosting service; this means that, all of the codes in this blog are fixed for each `git push`. So leaving the comment (without `git push`) will not be possible in github page itself. So we need third party plug-in for comments.
